Analysis on EU data regarding COVID19 in R Studio

Here you will find an analysis I did regarding COVID19 trends in the EU within R studio.
This analysis is particularly exciting to me as I was able to utilize packages such as: ggplott2, gridExtra, lubridate, tidyverse, and patchwork to help me analyze and visualize the data.
I was also able to carry out a statistical analysis to help me come to my conclusion. 

Attatched is both the rmd stcript and output as well as the html output. Incase one would like to run the script and analysis themselves the data used during this analyisis is found linked within the rmd and html files.
